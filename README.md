## 🛠️ Development Experience

### Quick Start
```cpp
#include <demoph/engine.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize Demoph Engine
    auto engine = Demoph::Engine::Create({
        .title = "My Game",
        .resolution = {1920, 1080},
        .api = Demoph::GraphicsAPI::Vulkan,
        .profile = Demoph::QualityProfile::Ultra
    });
    
    // Create scene
    auto scene = engine->CreateScene("MainScene");
    auto player = scene->CreateEntity("Player");
    
    // Component composition
    player->AddComponent<Demoph::Transform>();
    player->AddComponent<Demoph::MeshRenderer>("assets/models/character.fbx");
    player->AddComponent<Demoph::RigidBody>();
    player->AddComponent<Demoph::PlayerController>();
    
    // Start the experience
    return engine->Run();
}
```

### Python Scripting
```python
import demoph

class GameManager(demoph.ScriptComponent):
    def start(self):
        self.score = 0
        self.player = demoph.find_entity("Player")
        
    def update(self, dt):
        if demoph.input.key_pressed("SPACE"):
            self.spawn_powerup()
            
    def spawn_powerup(self):
        powerup = self.scene.create_entity("Powerup")
        powerup.add_component(demoph.Transform())
        powerup.add_component(demoph.MeshRenderer("powerup.fbx"))
        powerup.add_script(PowerupBehavior())
```
